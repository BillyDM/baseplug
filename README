  baseplug is a high-level model/view/controller-ish audio plugin framework.

  nightly-only right now, because of GATs.

  it's not ready, don't build anything important with it.
  your users' sessions will break.
  presets won't load right.
  automation will be incorrect.

  i'm making this public in its pre-pre-alpha state to get feedback from folks.

  please file issues if things act weird or something's unclear.

  do note that, though i have extensive experience in audio dev, i am largely a
  neophyte when it comes to advanced rust usage, proper code style and best
  practices. especially when it comes to error handling in procmacros.

  best way to get in touch is to join the rust audio discord:
