  baseplug is a high-level model/view/controller-ish audio plugin framework.

  nightly-only right now, because of GATs and min_specialization.

  baseplug is still largely prototypal, but is maturing quickly. i highly
  encourage looking at the examples and building experiments with it. though
  there will be API breakage in the future, i do not see a significant
  divergence from the existing structures.

  with that said, baseplug is not currently in a place where you should *ship*
  any plugins built with it. as the baseplug APIs change, there is a high
  likelihood that your users' sessions will break, presets won't load
  correctly, and automation will be incorrect.

  the primary goal for the 0.1 milestone is resolving these issues of
  forward-compatibility, and at that juncture we will lift the above advisement
  against shipping plugins.

  i'm making this public in its pre-pre-alpha state to get feedback from folks.

  please file issues if things act weird or something's unclear.

  do note that, though i have extensive experience in audio dev, i am largely a
  neophyte when it comes to advanced rust usage, proper code style and best
  practices. especially when it comes to error handling in procmacros.
